After installing the necessary libraries (numpy, nzmath, sympy), you can do
<pre>python benchmark.py -f semiprimes.csv</pre>
Be warned that your computer will be unusable as soon as it hits swap. And it will hit swap :). Granted, I was able to eat Mexican food and come back before that happened to me.

You might check if I'm done with [mpisieve](https://github.com/johnwalker/mpisieve), but if it's 2013 then I'm not.
